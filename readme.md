## why relay?
Note two important benefits in the GraphQL version:

All data is fetched in a single round trip.
The client and server are decoupled: the client specifies the data needed instead of relying on the server endpoint to return the correct data.
## queued records, records, and cached records?
### issue
Cache Consistency 
With GraphQL it is very common for the results of multiple queries to overlap. However, our response cache from the previous section doesn't account for this overlap â€” it caches based on distinct queries. For example, if we issue a query to fetch stories:

query { stories { id, text, likeCount } }
and then later refetch one of the stories whose likeCount has since been incremented:

query { story(id: "123") { id, text, likeCount } }
We'll now see different likeCounts depending on how the story is accessed. A view that uses the first query will see an outdated count, while a view using the second query will see the updated count.

### solution
```
type record = {
   DATAID:{
       field1: value,
       field2: value,
       field3: value,
       field4: value,
       field5: value,
       field6: Link(record)  //cyclic link is supported
   }
}

type recordStore = Array[record] // normalized and stored into a flat collection of records
                                 // With this approach each server record is stored once
                                 // regardless of how it is fetched.
type relayStore ={
    queueRecords: recordStore,
    records: recordStore,
    cachedRecords: recordStore
}


-------------------------------------
example 1 :
query {
  story(id: "1") {
    text,
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}

data: {
  story: {
     text: "Relay is open-source!",
     author: {
       name: "Jan"
     }
  }
}

Map {
  // `story(id: "1")`
  1: Map {
    text: 'Relay is open-source!',
    author: Link(2),
  },
  // `story.author`
  2: Map {
    name: 'Jan',
  },
};
---------------------------
example 2:
query {
  node(id: "1") {
    text,
    author { name, photo },
    comments {
      text,
      author { name, photo }
    }
  }
}

Map {
  // `story(id: "1")`
  1: Map {
    author: Link(2),
    comments: [Link(3)],
  },
  // `story.author`
  2: Map {
    name: 'Yuzhi',
    photo: 'http://.../photo1.jpg',
  },
  // `story.comments[0]`
  3: Map {
    author: Link(2),
  },
}

## View and Model
Achieving View Consistency 
The approach that Relay takes is to maintain a mapping from each UI view to the set of IDs it references. In this case, the story view would subscribe to updates on the story (1), the author (2), and the comments (3 and any others). When writing data into the cache, Relay tracks which IDs are affected and notifies only the views that are subscribed to those IDs. The affected views re-render, and unaffected views opt-out of re-rendering for better performance (Relay provides a safe but effective default shouldComponentUpdate). Without this strategy, every view would re-render for even the tiniest change.
